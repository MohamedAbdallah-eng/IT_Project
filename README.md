Part (1):
A Huffman Coder/Decoder using MATLAB.
The function takes a text file as an input and divide it into symbols then returns:
  1) Information of each symbol
  2) Entropy of the symbols
  3) A Dictionary that contains the symbols and the code of each symbol
  4) A text file containing the transmitted binary code as a string
  5) Efficiency of the code
  6) the compression ratio

After that, the function decodes the code at the receiver, write the received text in a new file and compare between the two files.

Part (2):
Channel coding and decoding using hamming
The function takes a source encoding signal and encoding it using hamming decoding
It compares between the error in case of channel encoded and not channel encoded signals after tranmsmitting through binary symmetric channel.
